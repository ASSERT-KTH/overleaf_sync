# overleaf-sync

Bidirectional live sync between Overleaf and an AI coding agent — without going through Git.

## The problem

Overleaf's Git integration is painful when two beings are editing simultaneously (human-human, human-agent): every push risks a conflict, and pushing while someone is typing in the browser fails outright. The Git bridge was not designed for high-frequency, automated writes.

## The solution

This project uses the Overleaf real-time collaboration protocol and speaks it directly. Changes flow both ways in real time — the same way a second browser tab would — so there are no commits, no pushes, and no conflicts.

## Status

Early MVP. The core sync loop is fully working:

- reads the current document state from Overleaf
- applies agent edits via `applyOtUpdate` (insert / delete ops)
- polls for remote changes and merges them locally
- triggers LaTeX compile on demand

Not yet covered: folder operations.

## Usage

```bash
pip install requests websocket-client

python3 overleaf_sync.py <project_id>
```

Get `overleaf_session2` from your browser cookies while logged in to overleaf.com. Get `project_id` from the URL (`/project/<id>`).

## Live concurrent editing

While a coauthor types, their ops are merged into the local file, never written over it (`test_concurrent_edits.py`):

- 🧾 State per doc: `content` = server doc + our in-flight op; the file = `content` + edits not pushed yet.
- 📥 A coauthor's op is transformed (ShareJS text OT, `transform_x`) past our in-flight op and past the unpushed local edits, then applied to the file.
- 📤 A local change is sent as one `applyOtUpdate`; it is acknowledged by its stripped `{v, doc}` echo, not by the callback (which only means "queued"). One in flight per doc.
- 🔁 If the push is rejected or never echoed: re-join the doc and 3-way merge the local file onto the server content.

## Reconnect invariants (data-loss prevention)

These invariants are enforced by the test suite in `test_sync_reconnect.py` (103 tests covering every combination of edits during a network outage).

### Scenario A — No edits during disconnection (idle outage)
Both sides unchanged. **No-op.** Local file stays as-is.

### Scenario B — Only server edits (stale local)
Local file is **identical to the last-synced state** (the user did not edit locally during the outage).  
✅ **Invariant:** the local file is **overwritten** with the latest server content. The poll loop does **NOT** push anything to Overleaf.  
💣 This was the critical data-loss bug: the old code treated a stale file as a pending local edit and pushed old content back to the server, reverting all changes made during the outage.

### Scenario C — Only local edits (genuine pending edits)
Local file has **new content** relative to the pre-disconnect state; server is unchanged.  
✅ **Invariant:** local edits are preserved as-is. The poll loop computes OT ops from server content → local content and pushes them to Overleaf.

### Scenario D — Both sides edited different, non-overlapping regions
Both local and server have new content in distinct parts of the document.  
✅ **Invariant:** a 3-way merge is performed: local changes are computed as OT ops against the old state, then applied on top of the server state. Both sides' changes survive. The poll loop then pushes the merged result to Overleaf.

### Scenario E — Both sides edited overlapping regions
Both local and server modified the same span of text.  
✅ **Invariant:** OT merge is applied deterministically. No crash, no corrupted output, no data loss. Insertions from both sides survive where OT semantics allow.

### Poll-loop correctness (always)
For every reconnect, the in-memory state is set to the server content. The poll loop then diffs (in-memory state → local file) and pushes the result.  
✅ **Invariant:** `apply_sharejs_ops(new_memory, ops_to_push) == new_local` — the poll loop always faithfully reproduces the merged local content.
